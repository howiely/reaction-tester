# Reaction Tester
*This is a customized version of Sai Nikhil's "Reaction Tester Game" used for research by my groupmates and I in PSYC 217 at the University of British Columbia.*

# Introduction
This fork was designed for use in my group's research study "The effects of stimuli on an individual's reaction time". Much of the original version's functionality has been stripped for use in an experimental environment; badges, highest streaks, and the one-second time limit have been removed for simplicity. Many of the aesthetic elements were removed in order to facilitate the use of this test in a research project done under the supervision of UBC instructors.

## Functionality
- **Reaction Time:** Calculated based on the time taken to click on a canvas shape as it appears by you.

- **Streak:** The number of times the user taps on the generated shape.

# Closing Remarks
Although I have some basic experience with coding, I'm not proficient enough to create a project like this on my own yet. As a result, none of this would be possible without Sai Nikhil and his work to create this game, and I'd like to extend a huge thank you to him for doing so on behalf of myself and my groupmates.
